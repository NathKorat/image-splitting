To split one image into small piece with custom factorial clusters. We made this for adjusting images splitting to enhance the pre-processing in machine learning.

After clone the project to your local machine, you can run it by using either jupyter notebook or `main.py`. If you run code in the console, you can run it by:

    python main.py -p <img_folder> -f <amnount of img> -o <folder_to_store_image>
